  <a class="lomosaltado">Lomo Saltado</a>

  <a class="ceviche"> Ceviche </a>
  <br>Seafood dish where diced cubes of raw fish marinate in a lemon or lime juice mixture, and the reaction of the citrus juices cures the fish protein and causes it to become opaque and firm while absorbing flavor. This process is called denaturing—you’re more familiar with the process of denaturing with heat, a.k.a. cooking, but this reaction achieves a similar effect. After curing, the fish is then served with colorful seasoning elements such as onions, cilantro, and peppers. It’s a simple and bracing dish where fresh fish and bright flavors are put on display.</br>

  <a > Aji de Gallina</a>
  <br>Classic Peruvian dish that is a great example of combining a European style of making a sauce (mainly French, in this case) with local aji amarillo chili mixed in. It's essentially shredded chicken wrapped in a creamy walnut and bread-thickened sauce with a little chili kick.</br>
